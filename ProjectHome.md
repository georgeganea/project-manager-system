Software project management system.

Table one :
the programmers - Name , id,...

Table two :
the tasks - id, status, number of required programmers

Table three :
who is doing what - programmer x is working on task y - a programmer can work on only ONE task at  a time :)

Use cases :

1.Manager adds, deletes, modifies a task - the system then tries to match the available programmers to the task.
2.Manager adds or removes a new programmer - a new employee maybe :)
3.Managers can request a report on who is doing what.
4.Managers can request a workload report.
